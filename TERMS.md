# Terms and Conditions

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-15

## Acceptance of Terms

By installing or using GameDayLive ("the app"), you agree to these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.

## Description of Service

The app provides automated game day threads and live score updates for sports teams by fetching publicly available data from sports APIs.

While the app can be installed in any subreddit, it maintains a list of authorized subreddits in which it will create threads and provide updates. This authorization system is necessary to help maintain operations due to API rate limits imposed by data providers. Moderators of subreddits may request authorization by contacting the app operator or submitting an issue or pull request on Github.

## Permitted Use

This app is provided "as-is" for non-commercial, informational purposes only. Users may not use this app to engage in spam, harassment, or any activity that violates the Reddit User Agreement.

## Data Source & Accuracy

Data is provided "as-is" from public APIs. While we strive for accuracy, the app is not responsible for delays, errors, or omissions in the game data.

The app does not make any guarantees of:

- Continuous availability or uptime
- Accuracy or timeliness of information
- Freedom from errors or interruptions

## Reddit's Terms

Use of the app is subject to Reddit's Terms of Service and Content Policy. You are responsible for ensuring your use complies with all Reddit policies.

- Use or inability to use the app
- Errors, interruptions, or data inaccuracies
- Any actions taken based on app-provided information

## Termination

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the app at any time without notice.
We reserve the right to terminate or restrict app access to any subreddit at our discretion, including for violations of these Terms or Reddit's policies.
The app's source code is available as open-source software—see the LICENSE file for terms regarding copying, modification, and redistribution.

## Disclaimers and Affiliation

This app is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any third-party entity, including the National Hockey League (NHL), Reddit, or any other organization.

## Changes to Terms

These Terms may be updated periodically. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
